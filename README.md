# Investment_Calculator

# Description:

This Python application, titled "Investment Return Calculator," is designed to provide a quick calculation of investment growth based on an initial investment amount and a specified return rate. It takes two inputs from the user: the initial investment amount (in dollars) and the expected return rate (as a percentage). Using these inputs, the program calculates and displays the final investment amount after applying the return rate.

This tool is particularly useful for estimating the future value of cryptocurrency or stock investments given an anticipated growth percentage. By entering different investment amounts and return rates, users can model various scenarios and assess potential gains.

# Features:

Prompts for user input to make it interactive.
Validates user input to handle incorrect entries.
Provides the final amount rounded to two decimal places for clear financial representation.

# Usage: Simply run the script in a Python environment. The program will prompt you for the required inputs and display the calculated final investment amount.
